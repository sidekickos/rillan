# Rillan Linear Seed Plan

This document is the issue-ready internal backlog for seeding a future `SidekickOS` Linear team and `Rillan` project. It is intentionally more concrete than the public repo roadmap, which should remain short and directional.

## Project

- Name: `Rillan`
- Team: `SidekickOS` (to be created)
- Public roadmap style: `Now / Next / Later`
- Internal roadmap style: explicit milestones and workstreams

## Milestones

### ~~Milestone 01 - Daemon Skeleton and Proxy~~ ✓ DONE

Completed in commits `0472bff` through `2efc2fd`. Delivered:
- Go daemon with Cobra CLI (`rillan serve`, `rillan init`)
- HTTP API on `localhost:8420` with `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/v1/chat/completions`
- OpenAI-compatible provider adapter with upstream forwarding
- YAML config with environment variable overrides and platform-specific defaults
- Structured logging with request IDs, request size limits, OpenAI-format errors
- ADR-001 (language/runtime), ADR-002 (defaults/filesystem)

### ~~Milestone 02 - Local Knowledge Substrate~~ ✓ DONE

Completed in commits `1a59f07` and `cb82ad5`. Delivered:
- SQLite metadata store with schema versioning (WAL mode, foreign keys)
- File discovery with include/exclude glob patterns, symlink/binary filtering, 1 MB limit
- Deterministic line-based chunking (default 120 lines) with stable chunk IDs
- Placeholder 8-dimensional vector embeddings (SHA256-derived, cosine similarity search)
- `rillan index` and `rillan status` CLI commands
- Full-rebuild indexing strategy (no incremental, no background watchers)
- ADR-003 (single root, manual indexing, embedded SQLite)

### Milestone 03 - Retrieval and Context Compilation — IN PROGRESS

Goal: inject local context into `/v1/chat/completions` through a bounded, inspectable compilation layer.

**Completed so far** (in working tree, not yet committed):
- Retrieval pipeline with settings resolution (global defaults + per-request overrides)
- Query builder extracting user message content
- Context compiler with bounded char limits and source references
- Debug metadata and summary extraction for response headers
- Integration into chat completions handler with debug headers (`X-Rillan-Retrieval-*`)
- Request sanitization (strips retrieval fields before upstream forwarding)

Remaining issues:

1. `Replace placeholder vector search with real embedding pipeline`
   - Current search uses 8-dim SHA256-derived vectors — functionally random similarity
   - Options: local embedding model via Ollama, or external embedding API endpoint
   - Define embedding config surface (model name, dimensions, endpoint)
   - Add embedding generation during indexing (replace placeholder in `internal/index/vectors.go`)
   - Update search to use real semantic similarity
   - Dependencies: M04 Ollama client may inform embedding endpoint choice

2. `Add BM25/FTS5 keyword search path`
   - The docs specify hybrid retrieval (keyword + semantic); current impl is vector-only
   - Add SQLite FTS5 index over chunk content during indexing
   - Implement keyword search as a parallel retrieval path
   - Combine keyword and vector results with score fusion (e.g., reciprocal rank fusion)
   - Dependencies: none (SQLite FTS5 is already available via modernc.org/sqlite)

3. `Add retrieval integration tests with realistic corpus`
   - Current test fixtures are minimal smoke tests
   - Add end-to-end test: index a real-ish project → query → verify context injection
   - Cover edge cases: empty index, no matches, truncation, per-request overrides
   - Dependencies: retrieval pipeline stable

Definition of done:

- Rillan can answer a chat request using meaningfully retrieved local context
- Retrieval supports at least one real similarity signal (keyword or embedding)
- Retrieval remains bounded and source-aware
- Provider adapters stay separate from retrieval logic

### Milestone 04 - Local Model Helpers

Goal: add optional small-model helper behavior through Ollama without making local models a core daemon dependency. This is the foundation for intent classification, query rewriting, and future IP fragmentation.

Issues:

1. `Add Ollama client and local model config surface`
   - Add config section: `local_model.base_url` (default `http://localhost:11434`), `local_model.enabled`
   - Implement HTTP client targeting Ollama's OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` and `/api/embeddings`
   - Client must handle Ollama being unavailable gracefully (timeouts, circuit breaker)
   - Keep daemon startup independent of Ollama availability — surface as status, not readiness
   - Dependencies: existing config/runtime surfaces

2. `Implement local embedding generation for indexing`
   - Use Ollama embedding endpoint (`/api/embeddings`) with a small model (e.g., `nomic-embed-text`)
   - Replace placeholder 8-dim vectors with real embeddings during `rillan index`
   - Make embedding model and dimensions configurable
   - Fall back to placeholder vectors when Ollama is unavailable (with warning)
   - Dependencies: Ollama client

3. `Implement query rewriting helper flow`
   - Use a small local model (1-3B params) to rewrite user queries before retrieval
   - Transform conversational queries into focused search queries
   - Keep the helper optional — bypass when Ollama is unavailable
   - Add config toggle: `local_model.query_rewrite.enabled`
   - Dependencies: Ollama client, retrieval pipeline

4. `Implement contextual grep expansion helper`
   - Use local helper models for search-query expansion or normalization
   - Expand abbreviated terms, resolve synonyms, suggest related identifiers
   - Keep grep orchestration observable and overridable
   - Dependencies: Ollama client

5. `Expose helper health/status without coupling daemon readiness to Ollama`
   - Add local model status to `rillan status` output (connected, model available, latency)
   - Surface in `/readyz` response body as informational, not as a readiness gate
   - Keep `readyz` semantics stable — daemon is ready even without Ollama
   - Dependencies: Ollama client integration

Definition of done:

- Rillan can use a local helper model for embeddings and query rewriting when configured
- Core daemon behavior still works when Ollama is absent
- `rillan status` reports local model connectivity

### Milestone 05 - Intent Classification and Policy

Goal: add local intent classification and the first layer of the tiered security model, making Rillan context-aware about what it's sending and where.

Issues:

1. `Implement intent classification via local model`
   - Classify incoming requests using a small local model (1-3B params on GPU)
   - Output: `action_type` (code_diagnosis, code_generation, architecture, explanation, refactor, review, general_qa)
   - Output: `sensitivity` estimate (public, ip_protected, ip_core, trade_secret)
   - Output: `requires_context` (boolean — does this need vault retrieval?)
   - Output: `execution_mode` (direct, plan_first)
   - Keep classification optional — bypass when local model unavailable
   - Dependencies: M04 Ollama client

2. `Add tier-1 project config (`.sidekick/project.yaml`)`
   - Project name, classification level (open_source, internal, proprietary, trade_secret)
   - Source directories to auto-index with type annotations
   - Routing preferences per task type
   - System prompt and project-specific instructions
   - CRITICAL: no sensitive data in this file — safe to commit
   - Dependencies: none

3. `Add deterministic secret scanning on outbound requests`
   - Regex-based scanning for API keys, tokens, credentials, common secret patterns
   - Scan compiled context and full outbound payload before provider dispatch
   - Block or redact secrets based on match confidence
   - Make patterns configurable and extensible
   - Dependencies: retrieval/context pipeline stable

4. `Add outbound request policy seam`
   - Insert a policy evaluation point between context compilation and provider dispatch
   - Policy inputs: intent classification, project classification, secret scan results
   - Policy outputs: allow, redact, block, route-to-local-only
   - Keep the seam structural — full tier-0/tier-2 merge comes later
   - Dependencies: intent classification, secret scanning

5. `Add routing decisions based on sensitivity`
   - Use intent classification and project config to influence provider selection
   - `trade_secret` → local-only inference (hard deny cloud)
   - `proprietary` → cloud with redaction
   - `internal` → cloud with employer stripping
   - `open_source` → cloud with targeted retrieval only
   - Dependencies: policy seam, intent classification

6. `Add correction memory system`
   - Store user corrections as project-scoped anti-pattern artifacts
   - Auto-include in future context packages for the same project
   - Immutable and indexed like other artifacts
   - Prevents repeated misunderstandings across sessions
   - Dependencies: vault/index infrastructure

Definition of done:

- Rillan classifies intent and sensitivity of requests when local model is available
- Secret scanning blocks or redacts known credential patterns on outbound requests
- Routing decisions respect project classification level
- Policy enforcement is structural and observable in logs

### Milestone 06 - Security Hardening and Packaging

Goal: complete the tiered security model and make local deployment durable on macOS and Linux.

Issues:

1. `Implement tier-0 system identity config (`~/.sidekick/system.yaml`, encrypted)`
   - Personal PII patterns (name, email, phone, address)
   - PCI patterns (credit card, bank account, SSN)
   - Employer references (hashed, opaque)
   - Credential format detection rules
   - System rules (IF open_source THEN strip employer refs; IF remote_provider THEN mask PII)
   - Encrypted via OS keychain integration
   - NEVER committed, never leaves the machine
   - Dependencies: M05 policy seam

2. `Implement tier-2 runtime policy merge`
   - Ephemeral, in-memory only — never persisted in combined form
   - Load tier-0 + tier-1 → evaluate system rules against project classification
   - Scan outbound package against tier-0 patterns
   - Apply transformations (masking, stripping, abstracting)
   - Make routing decision → record in audit ledger → discard merged policy
   - Dependencies: tier-0 config, M05 policy seam

3. `Add IP fragmentation strategies`
   - Level 1 — Targeted retrieval: send only relevant section, not full file (deterministic, always on for remote)
   - Level 2 — Abstraction rewriting: generalize implementation specifics via local model before cloud send
   - Level 3 — Question extraction: distill to pure technical form with zero project context
   - Strategy selection driven by project classification level
   - Dependencies: tier-2 policy, local model helpers

4. `Implement audit ledger (append-only)`
   - Record every request/response: request ID, engine, model version
   - Hashes of outbound payload (optionally encrypted snapshot)
   - Artifacts referenced + chunk hashes
   - Policy decisions applied, response hash
   - Enable forensics ("what left my machine and why?"), reproducibility, compliance
   - Dependencies: policy pipeline

5. `Add macOS launchd packaging path`
   - launchd plist for `rillan serve` as a user-level service
   - Install/uninstall tooling or documentation
   - Log routing to system log or dedicated file
   - Dependencies: daemon startup flow stable

6. `Add Linux systemd packaging path`
   - systemd user unit file for `rillan serve`
   - Install/uninstall tooling or documentation
   - Journal integration for structured logs
   - Dependencies: daemon startup flow stable

7. `Harden release packaging and local service install flow`
   - Signed release artifacts with cosign keyless provenance
   - Cross-platform builds: `darwin` and `linux` on `amd64` and `arm64`
   - Checksum files, verification docs
   - Dependencies: OSS readiness release pipeline

Definition of done:

- Full three-tier security model operational (tier-0 encrypted, tier-1 committable, tier-2 ephemeral)
- IP fragmentation strategies available for proprietary/trade-secret projects
- Audit ledger records all egress with policy trace
- macOS and Linux have documented, repeatable service-install flows
- Release artifacts are signed and verifiable

### Milestone 07 - Agent Runtime (Post-v1)

Goal: evolve Rillan from a proxy into a local-first agent runtime with explicit orchestration, role-specific agents, and structured artifact passing.

Issues:

1. `Define agent orchestration model and role boundaries`
   - Core roles: Orchestrator, Planner, Coder, Researcher, Reviewer
   - Orchestrator: classifies requests, decides direct vs planned execution, assigns steps, synthesizes responses
   - Planner: converts goals into executable plans with dependencies and acceptance criteria
   - Coder: inspects code, produces bounded edits, runs targeted verification
   - Researcher: gathers repo facts, queries local index, prepares evidence bundles
   - Reviewer: validates implementation against plan, identifies regressions
   - Design principle: agents decide; skills execute
   - Dependencies: M05 intent classification

2. `Implement reusable skill system`
   - Initial skills: read_files, search_repo, apply_patch, run_tests, git_status, git_diff, index_lookup
   - Skills are atomic, bounded operations with typed inputs/outputs
   - No broad context transcript passing — structured artifact handoff instead
   - Dependencies: agent role definitions

3. `Add MCP integration for environment awareness`
   - Daemon connects to user environment via MCP servers (IDE, OS, collaboration tools)
   - IDE servers: open files, cursor position, compilation errors, project structure
   - OS servers: active application, clipboard, filesystem watches, terminal output
   - Collaboration servers: Git, GitHub PRs/issues, Jira/Linear tickets
   - Environment synthesizer merges MCP signals into coherent snapshot
   - Dependencies: agent orchestration

4. `Implement action gating and confirmation`
   - v1 policy: ALL actions require explicit user confirmation
   - Future evolution: per-action-type trust levels, per-MCP-server trust levels
   - Action proposals returned to client; execution only on approval
   - Dependencies: MCP integration, agent roles

5. `Add context package builder for agent handoffs`
   - Provider-agnostic Context Package: task, constraints, working_memory, facts, evidence, open_questions, output_schema, budget, policy_trace
   - Each agent step gets a compiled package, not raw conversation history
   - Budget enforcement: token/size limits per section
   - Dependencies: context compiler (M03), policy pipeline (M05)

Definition of done:

- Rillan can orchestrate multi-step tasks through role-specific agents
- Agent handoffs use structured artifacts, not raw transcripts
- MCP provides real-time environment context to the agent runtime
- All agent actions are gated by user confirmation

### OSS Readiness

Goal: make the repository publishable, governable, and releasable as an open-source project. Can run in parallel with M04+.

Issues:

1. `Add Apache-2.0 license and rename-friendly ownership wording`
   - Use broad-adoption licensing
   - Keep temporary ownership naming easy to update later
   - Dependencies: none

2. `Add contributing guide with enforced DCO workflow`
   - Document DCO sign-off requirements
   - Keep CLA out for now
   - Dependencies: none

3. `Add SECURITY.md using GitHub Security Advisories`
   - Define private disclosure path
   - Dependencies: none

4. `Add Contributor Covenant and community templates`
   - Add code of conduct, issue templates, PR template
   - Dependencies: none

5. `Add Rillan-native governance and doctrine docs`
   - `THESIS.md` — the four foundational principles (context as local asset, providers as interchangeable solvers, acquisition+packaging as product, audit as default)
   - `PRINCIPLES.md` — code-first not code-only, headless daemon, no UI assumptions
   - `GUARDRAILS.md` — local binding default, Anthropic policy, no unofficial access, indexing constraints
   - `GOVERNANCE.md` — contribution model, decision-making, maintainer responsibilities
   - Dependencies: current planning decisions captured

6. `Add public Now/Next/Later roadmap`
   - Keep external roadmap brief and comprehensible
   - Dependencies: milestone sequence stable enough for publication

7. `Add signed release workflow with cosign keyless provenance`
   - GitHub Releases first
   - `darwin` and `linux` on `amd64` and `arm64`
   - Any GitHub-verified commit signature accepted on protected branches
   - Dependencies: repo publishing posture stable

8. `Add release checklist and artifact verification guidance`
   - Document how users verify checksums, signatures, and provenance
   - Dependencies: signing workflow

Definition of done:

- The repo can be published publicly without obvious governance or release-process gaps
- Contributors can understand how to participate safely and correctly

## Public Roadmap Translation

The public repo roadmap should stay much simpler than Linear:

- `Now`: finish retrieval pipeline with real similarity, stabilize context compilation
- `Next`: local model helpers (Ollama), intent classification, secret scanning, policy seam
- `Later`: full tiered security, IP fragmentation, audit ledger, agent runtime, OS-native packaging

## Current Known Blockers

1. The `SidekickOS` team does not yet exist in Linear, so project placement is blocked.
2. Actual issue creation should wait until the project lives under the correct team.
3. Real embedding support (M03 remaining / M04) depends on Ollama client work — these may need to be sequenced together.
4. Tier-0 encrypted config requires OS keychain integration research per platform.

## Immediate Next Moves Once SidekickOS Team Exists

1. Create `Rillan` project under `SidekickOS`
2. Add milestones from this document
3. Seed issues milestone by milestone
4. Keep repo-facing roadmap and docs simpler than Linear internals
